    <p>I know it's not something that you would eat for dinner, but cake is my all time favorite dessert and if it
        weren't for societal restrictions I would eat it everyday. I love cakes that have good frosting, I believe
        frosting is what makes a cake. If it doesn't have good frosting then I don't want it!</p>
