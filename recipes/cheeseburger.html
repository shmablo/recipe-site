    <p>You can never go wrong with a good old american cheeseburger! It never gets old, I may go a long time without
        eating one but when I get that urge to dig into one it always hits the spot. I enjoy my burgers with almost
        everything it comes with, pickles, tomatoes, onions, lettuce. It all adds to the burger in the right ways,
        perfection!</p>
