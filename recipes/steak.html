    <p1>One of my favorite things to eat for dinner is steak. However, I like my steak cooked in a very particular way.
        I like to cook my steak to a nice medium well with a good amount of red in the middle. I think medium well is
        perfect, it doesn't feel under cooked but you still get the juices of the steak.</p1>

    <h2>How to Grill a Steak the Pablo Way</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Clean your grill with a scraper, then wipe it down.</li>
        <li>Turn on the gril and let it get hot</li>
        <li>While it's getting hot start cutting your steak into slices and drizzle salt on them</li>
        <li>When ready, put them on the grill and let it cook until you see the juices start coming out the top</li>
        <li>Flip the steak and let it cook for about 30 seconds</li>
        <li>Take steak off with a tong and place on cutting board</li>
        <li>Cut into pieces and enjoy!</li>
    </ul>
